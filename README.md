<b> Automatic Door Lock using Morse Code </b><br>
Designed and implemented an Arduino-based door lock system that uses Morse code as the authentication 
mechanism. Integrated a servo motor to control door locking/unlocking and a buzzer to indicate 
incorrect password attempts. Programmed custom Morse code decoding logic in Arduino IDE for real-time 
input validation, ensuring enhanced security and innovative user interaction.
